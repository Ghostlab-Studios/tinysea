    /// <summary>
    /// This script is designed to calculate a temperature based on the current day
    /// The temperature is based on three conditions: The warming trend of the ocean [var trend], 
    /// 												the changing seasons [var season], 
    /// 												and the growing instability of the temperature [var sd] 
    /// The first two conditions are based on simple linear functions, and the sum of which represent the desired average temperature [var mean]
    /// The instability/standard deviation grows linearly from .3 - 8 (These two values will be represented by [var sdMin, sdMax])
    /// The final temperature is derived from a gaussian random sampling, using the expected average temperature and the standard deviation
    /// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    /// 	: Notes on this code:
    /// 		- There isn't rounding of the final value to a desired decimal point
    /// 		- The math here uses floats, which have memory restrictions: may not create the minutia that is desired
    /// 		- Because the season equation has no horizontal translation, the game will start with temperatures around 25 degrees, rather than
    /// 				20 degrees right down the middle 
    /// 		- This code uses the Box-Muller method of randomization. The Ziggurat Algorithm is technically cheaper, 
    /// 				but it shouldn't make a difference
    /// 		- The name of this class is really awful I'm sorry
